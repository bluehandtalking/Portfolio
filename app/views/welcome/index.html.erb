  O.K., that may not have grabbed you. What you need is some vision and 
  a clear path on how to get there. And when you get there an app that
  works great, looks great, and has low maintenance. Oh, and it gets built fast

  Those are the qualities I can bring to your project. Agile development built on
  stories, solid testing, and clarity. You will save 80% in maintenance by using
  good test driven design. Using minitest, rspec, capybara, selenium, and the fast
  rails development environment. jQuery front end using Zurb Foundation or 
  Bootstrap.<br />
